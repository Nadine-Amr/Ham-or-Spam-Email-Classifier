# Ham-or-Spam-Email-Classifier

Logistic regression and a multinomial naive bayes classifier are separately used to classify emails into spam or ‘ham’. The text feature "TFIDF" (term frequency–inverse document frequency) is extracted and used in the classification with the help of the machine learning toolkit: scikit-learn.
